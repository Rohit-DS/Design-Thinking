# WalStore Supermarket chain

WalStore, a supermarket chain, has successfully grown from a few stores in just one city in the U.S. to over a hundred stores spread across 10 cities. 
As they are gearing up for the next wave of expansion to become a nationwide supermarket chain, they want to optimise their operations in order to ensure cost efficiencies. 
They have engaged a leading consulting firm, McBride & Co., to make recommendations about how WalStoreâ€™s end-to-end operations can be optimised.
